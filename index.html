    Logic Manual is a relatively brief introduction to logic. I have tried to
    focus on the core topics and have neglected some issues that are covered
    in more comprehensive books such as Forbes (1994), Guttenplan (1997),
    Hodges (2001), Smith (2003), and Tennant (1990). In particular, I have
    tried not to include material that is inessential to Preliminary Examinations and Moderations in Oxford.
